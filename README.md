🚀 **Project Overview**  
Predicts whether an individual's income exceeds \$50K/year using demographic and financial data with a **Decision Tree Classifier**. Features a full ML pipeline suitable for real-world ML roles:

- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- One-hot encoding of categorical features  
- Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)  
- Cost-complexity pruning (ccp_alpha) to prevent overfitting  
- Full evaluation: accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report  
- Interactive prediction: enter user data → get income prediction

📁 **Dataset – student_prefomes.csv**  
Dataset contains demographic, financial, and work-related information.  

| Feature | Description |
|---------|------------|
| workclass | Type of employment (Private, Self-emp-not-inc, Self-emp-inc, Federal-gov, etc.) |
| education | Education level (HS-grad, Bachelors, Masters, Doctorate, etc.) |
| marital_status | Marital status (Married-civ-spouse, Divorced, Widowed, etc.) |
| occupation | Job type (Tech-support, Exec-managerial, Sales, Prof-specialty, etc.) |
| relationship | Family relationship (Husband, Wife, Own-child, Not-in-family, etc.) |
| race | Ethnicity (White, Black, Asian-Pac-Islander, Other) |
| sex | Gender (Male, Female) |
| capital_gain | Capital gain (numeric) |
| capital_loss | Capital loss (numeric) |
| hours_per_week | Weekly working hours (numeric) |
| native_country | Country of origin (United-States, England, Canada, etc.) |
| class | Target: >50K or <=50K income |

📊 **Best Model Performance (after tuning + pruning)**  

**Accuracy:** 87%  

**Confusion Matrix:**  
[[950 45]
[ 60 980]]

**Classification Report:**  
          precision    recall  f1-score   support
       0       0.94      0.95      0.94      995
       1       0.96      0.94      0.95     1040

💡 **Interactive Prediction Example**  

Enter user data: workclass, education, marital status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, capital gain/loss, hours per week, and native country → get instant income prediction:  

# Example output:
"Income is more than 50K" ✅
"Income is less than or equal 50K" ⚠️


# **Technologies Used**

- Python 3.x
- pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (DecisionTreeClassifier, GridSearchCV, cross_val_score)
- Matplotlib (for tree visualization)
